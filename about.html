						</header>
						<p>An Unconference is a method where the agenda for the event is set up by the attendees at the beginning of the day. This event design philosophy and facilitation focuses on maximizing collaboration and peer sharing.  We invite any participant to  propose and facilitate a session. Participants can attend a  session, or move to another  sessions as they see fit.  We hope to maximise the collective untapped knowledge and experience of the participants, and we strive to tap that vast store by maximizing dialog, creativity, idea exchange, and the ability to build solidarity.</p>
							
						<p>See ‘Become a Buddy’ below for more information on proposing a session and also the other ways that you can contribute to The Open Exchange.</p>
